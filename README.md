# Game Project - Helicopter 
---
## Summary of the Game project
Start Date: 09.09.2019 / End date: 11.09.2019
***
Day 1) Create two window: MainWindow for Gameplay and MessageScreen for Message.
> MainWindow: Design the interface and the code the mouseclick and keyboard event to recognise the image through the button.

> MessageScreen: Design the interface and when the player press "Space" it will close the MessageScreen window and open the MainWindow. 

> Problems: no problem with design interface however i only have to change on the design, it was to change "Helicopter image" to button and place the image within the button. 

***
Day 2) Work on the Helicopter and obstalce animation

> I was working on the helicopter animation which can be control by key up or key down or mouse click. added a timer to calcuate the     distance. this is helpful because i can stop the timer, when the player collide with the obstacle and it will end the game and show the final distance result on the message box 

> Problems: I was trying to follow window forms techniques however in WPF, some of the techniques does not work and most of the time was wasted due to that. E.g. Bounds for colllision however bounds function does not exist in the WPF.
